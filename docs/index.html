            <p>
                Modeling flocks has a wide variety of applications. It can be used to model molecular behavior 
                in science, simulate crowds to envision bottlenecks in a building plan, mimic natural movement 
                of animal behavior, and can be used by animators to fill easily scenes with large masses of 
                other characters. Therefore simulations with flocks or boids (bird-oid objects) can be adapted 
                to fit many different purposes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following project, I simulated a visually realistic depiction of a school of fish 
                (although this can be adapted to other creatures and items) using particle systems and the 
                simple forces of classic flocks. I also applied obstacle avoidance and fish feeding features.
            </p>
        <h4 class="center-text mt-5 mb-3">Basic flocking behavior</h4>
            <p>
                Basic flocking behavior is dictated by the steering of the fish or the direction that they choose to 
                move in. Craig Reynolds</a> outlined the movement of boids 
                as being comprised of 3 simple steering behaviors. [Images from <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Craig Reynolds</a>]

                  In addition, one thing to consider is the field of view of each fish. In reality, the fish
                  cannot be perfectly informed of their surroundings. The fish can only make their decisions
                  based off of what they know: their sight. The following images from 
                  <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-for-game/0596005555/ch04.html">AI for Game Developers</a>
                  depict the field of view for boids. The size affects the level of awareness that the fish 
                  has of its surroundings. Additionally, I considered the depth of field: how far the fish could
                  see along that field of view. The fish will only call another fish its "neighbor" (and thus 
                  consider it when steering itself) if it is within view. 
              </p>

            <p>For each fish, I computed the steering directions according to each of the aforementioned factors, 
                making sure to only consider neighbors (fish within view). The tricky part was combining them and 
                finding a good balance of all three of the factors, as there can only be one final steering 
                direction. I found that with equal weighting, the fish had a tendency to collide still, so I 
                assigned greater weight to the separation steering direction. In addition, since I felt that the 
                visual of the fish moving in one direction was important to conveying a visually realistic animation, 
                I also assigned greater weight to the alignment steering direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I did notice that a drawback of the higher weighting of the separation steering was that the fish
              on the outer edges of the school had a tendency to stray. To try and fix that, I dynamically changed the 
              velocity of the fish. If the average position of all of its neighbors was very far, the fish increased its
              velocity in order to catch up with the school. I found that this helped in getting the fish to align themselves
              to other schools quicker if they ended up straying. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there were some situations where the fish would be conflicted and want to go in two different
              directions and they would keep turning from side to side. To minimize this effect, the final steering
              direction is the halfvector between the current steering direction and unit vector combining the flocking
              components.

        <h4 class="center-text mt-4 mb-3">Fish Food</h4>
            <p>To implement the behavior of fish feeding, I first updated the GUI so that clicking would add a new piece of food where
              the mouse clicked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To change the behavior of the fish when food was present, I again considered only the food within the fish's field of 
              view. If there was no food in view, the fish would use the default flocking steering outlined in the previous section.
              The fish would choose to move towards the food that is closest to it. Therefore when there is a lot of food, the
              fish will move in a way that maximizes its ability to reach as much food as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I computed the direction that the fish needed to go in to reach the closest piece of food by simply creating a unit vector 
              from the fish's position to the food's position. In order to apply use that vector to compute the final direction that 
              the fish would ultimately go in, I applied a weighted average between the separation steering vector and the vector 
              towards the food. I gave the separation a greater weight as with all the fish moving towards the food it tends to 
              cause collisions. I also chose to omit the cohesion and alignment factors of flocking behavior as the movement towards 
              the food would inherently cause that behavior since all the fish are moving towards the same position: the food.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order for the fish to "eat" the food once it reached it, I checked to see if the fish was within a certain distance
              from the food using a small constant (to account for the fact that the fish is much larger than its position/centroid).
              If the fish was close enough, I considered the food "eaten" and removed it from the GUI and from memory. As a result,
              the fish would return to their normal flocking behavior once they ate the food.
            </p>

            <h5 class="center-text">Effect of different FOVs on feeding behavior</h5>
            <p>
              The results below depict how the fish will only swim towards food within their field of view. As expected, the
              fish with a wider field of view are better at scavenging food.

        <h4 class="center-text mt-4 mb-3">Obstacle Avoidance</h4>
        <p>
          For obstacle avoidance, I used a combination of techniques outlined in 
          <a href = "https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-steering-behaviors-collision-avoidance--gamedev-7777">
            this article</a> and techniques borrowed from raytracing. First, I checked to see if the fish would eventually hit an
            obstacle, given the current steering direction, by applying an intersection test with the obstacle. In this case,
            the "ray" was cast from the fish towards the obstacle. Since my obstacles were spheres, I applied the ray intersection
            test with spheres outlined in <a href = "https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp18/lecture/ray-intro/slide_024">the raytracing
            lecture</a>. The obstacle that was most threatening and therefore most important to dodge, was the one with closest 
            intersection point (the black dot in the image below) among all possible obstacle intersections. 
        </p>
        <div class="row pt-4 pb-5 pr-5 pl-5">
          <div class="col-sm">

          <div class="col-sm">
            <p>
              <b>One the most threatening object was identified, the fish need to redirect themselves to avoid it.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              I calculated an
              avoidance vector (in red), a perpendicular vector to the original direction. The length of the avoidance vector is
              the radius of the obstacle plus a small constant (so that the fish doesn't get too close to the object). The avoidance
              vector is used to calculate the point where the green and red vector touch, as the new direction is a vector from the 
              fish's position to that point. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose to only use the new direction (that avoids the obstacle) and the separation direction to compute the final 
              steering direction, for the same reasoning as with the food.

        <b>Edge cases</b>
        <p>
          In the case of food AND an obstacle, the fish will prioritize the closest object. In this case, the fish will still be 
          able to eat food that is very close to the obstacle, and then swerve. In addition, if the food is inside an obstacle or 
          adequately close to it such that the fish will not be able to swerve without collision, the fish will ignore the
          food.
